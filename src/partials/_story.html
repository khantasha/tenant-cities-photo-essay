        <p>A pandemic that impacted income for many families also prompted federal, state and local actions to reduce evictions. But a far-reaching full moratorium gave way to much more limited restrictions, even as many renters continued to struggle. The results included more than 3,200 eviction cases filed by landlords in Allegheny County in the past year, sending some tenants scrambling amid COVID-19 and a longstanding affordable housing crisis.</p>

        <p>Since January, PublicSource and <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/" target="_blank">WESA</a> have been spending time with households facing eviction, as part of the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/series/tenant-cities/">Tenant Cities series</a>. We’ve seen tenants try to tap rent relief, scrape to make payments, or take the difficult step of trying to move during a pandemic. Here are portraits of four households we’ve met.</p>

        <p>Shanese Nelson said she’d been renting from her cousin, Todd Davis, since January 2020 and had complained to him about the unfinished state of the Penn Hills apartment – raw wood, unpainted drywall, leaky plumbing,  and more loose light fixtures, closed doors that did not open or close readily and holes in walls.</p>

        <p>When her lease expired Jan. 10 – even though her rent was current and the pandemic was raging – Davis filed a landlord/tenant complaint against her. Davis did not comment for the record when contacted by PublicSource.</p>

        <p>With two small children and COVID-19 keeping many landlords from showing apartments, moving wouldn’t be simple. “It’s not easy to just move because [the landlord wants] me to move,” said Nelson, who also works full-time as a certified nursing assistant. “I wish it was easy. I’d have been out of here.”</p>

        <p>“In a few years, I’m trying to buy a house,” she said. Until this year, she didn’t have so much as a traffic ticket on her record. Now she has an eviction case. “And this is petty. This is real petty.”</p>

        <p>Mizak took and passed the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test in March, in hopes of getting into the Air Force. The 21-year-old hoped that this would eventually open a path to get into a police academy.</p>

        <p>“I’m hoping that I can get, like, sworn in [by the Air Force] and everything before my eviction date,” she said in early March. “Because they’ll send The Alden a letter saying that because of military reasons, I have to leave.”</p>

        <p>On March 31, she told PublicSource that she had been sworn into the Air Force, and would be leaving for training by the end of April. Mizak hopes she could get the eviction scrubbed from her record.</p>

        <p>Another mother, Ebony Long, spent the early months of the pandemic doing customer service work for a medical benefits company from home, while caring for a toddler son and, sometimes, her two preteen daughters. But eventually, it got to be too much.</p>

        <p>“I lost my job,” said Long. “And then with me trying to do everything else, pay for food, I'm not getting food stamps. ...I couldn't pay rent.” Her unemployment claim took forever.</p>

        <p>In November, her landlord, Ragab Refaei, filed to evict. Twelve days later, a district judge ruled in Refaei’s favor, giving him the right to have her ousted from the Perry South house.</p>

        <p>She confirmed some damage, but added that she already arranged to pay for repairs. The rest of the allegations, she denied. A judge referred the case to arbitration.</p>

        <p>She’s stayed in a shelter before, and doesn’t think it would be good for her toddler son. “My plan is I've been looking for somewhere else to move, but for now is to just pay this rent.”</p>

        <p>The back rent piled up despite Davis’ payments of $4,669 to the landlord from August through December, and despite an <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/tenant-cities-landlord-tenant-allegheny-county-pittsburgh-eviction-moratorium-rent-relief-pennsylvania-covid-coronavirius/" target="_blank">application for rent relief</a>, which was denied.</p>

And it's not just about people who cannot pay their rent,” he said. “It sounds like to me there's an economic virus and there sounds like to me that there is a hidden agenda” involving “gentrification” and “oppression.”</p>
