          <p>Livable minimum wage is a topic that is being debated in state capitols across the country these days. It has raised questions about how we value labor and, by extension, the people who do the lowest paying jobs in this country. Illinois recently passed a $15-an-hour minimum wage bill. It’s the fifth state to do so. California, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and New York are all implementing stepped transitions to the $15-an-hour minimum wage.</p>

          <p>In Pennsylvania, there is no livable minimum wage law, though Gov. Tom Wolf has continually advocated for a minimum wage increase since taking office in 2015. In the absence of this legislation, are we, in effect, saying that it is acceptable for some people to live trapped in a cycle of poverty, subsidizing our enjoyment of the goods and services they deliver? </p>

          <p>As employers, we have the power to make a different choice and lead the way forward even when our legislators may not yet be ready. A model from a unique collaboration in Pittsburgh can show us how to acknowledge the value of each others’ labor, agree to pay people adequately for the work they do, support their transition to better jobs, and no longer demand that poor people subsidize our fast food, our hospitals and even our green assets, through their entrenched poverty.</p>

          <p>I come at this question because I run a small Pittsburgh social enterprise nonprofit called Landforce, which combines workforce readiness and environmental stewardship. With seven full-time staff and 24 seasonal staff (and my graying hair), believe me when I say I know what it means to worry about payroll. Yet, this year, with a dedicated board of directors, we are committing to raising the wages from $13 an hour to $15 for those seasonal employees who complete the initial training program. As a social enterprise, their wages will all come from the environmental stewardship contracts we work on.</p>

          <h6>“As employers, we have the power to make a different choice and lead the way forward even when our legislators may not yet be ready.”</h6>

          <p>So why would we ever willingly, without any pressure from our employees, raise wages to $15 an hour? Beyond the myriad of economic goals behind why a minimum wage increase is beneficial, there are two reasons: because we value our crew members’ labor and because we value our crew members.</p>

          <p>Landforce crew members work hard in the heat, sun and rain to ensure that our region has a healthier, more welcoming environment. Crews construct trails; tend increasing numbers of rain gardens and green stormwater runoff areas; plant trees along slippery river banks or steep hillsides; remove invasive knotweed, vines and other plants from our woodlands; and construct garden beds for communities to grow fresh food. This is all hot, heavy, physically and mentally challenging work, which results in a host of environmental benefits and more livable communities we can all enjoy.</p>

          <p>We also value the people who do this work. Our crew members arrive at Landforce, sometimes suffering from longstanding mental health issues or struggling with substance abuse, perhaps on their way home from incarceration, perhaps just never having successfully applied for a job before. What unifies all of our crew members is the constant, day-to-day worry about money — the where’s my next meal coming from, fear of eviction, how do I pay for the bus to work and buy diapers for my baby kind of worry. We have seen that this kind of constant, unrelenting anxiety has serious damaging effects. It affects our crew members’ ability to make good decisions, to follow through on a plan and, above all, to imagine that things will get better. How can our crew members work toward their professional goals — passing a driving permit test, clearing fines from licenses, registering for college courses, attending therapy, staying sober — if they need to work a second job just to pay rent? How are they supposed to make their own lives better if they spend their time running in place only to discover they’re actually sliding backward? It is soul destroying. And none of us deserves to have our soul destroyed.</p>

          <p>We are willing and able to pay a more livable wage because we depend upon a strong network of partners. We rely on three key collaborations: foundation, donor and governmental support for our training and coaching components; employers who are eager to hire former crew members; and public and private entities that contract with us to conduct the environmental work.</p>

          <p>Seasonal crew wages all come from stewardship contracts with partners who, while making business decisions, also understand that we all need to have a hand in ensuring that Pittsburgh becomes a more just and equitable city. So while we are a nonprofit, the wage we pay our crew members is a business decision based upon what the market will bear.</p>

          <p>While working on environmental projects for municipalities, developers or nonprofits, our seasonal crew members gain and practice important work-readiness skills they have learned during an intensive training period. All the while, crew members’ professional goals are supported by one-on-one career coaching. Last year, 92 percent of crew members who finished their terms with us were offered jobs by other employers within a couple of weeks of the end of the season.</p>

          <p>And while there is room for debate if even this is an adequate living wage, it is a good place for employers to start to push the conversation and show Pennsylvania legislators that we value the people who work with us as well as the work they do. Otherwise, when we insist upon paying wages that don’t allow people to live with a modicum of safety and security, we crush them. We demoralize them. We demean them. And, we do this all while enjoying the fruits of their labor — the clean hospitals, the cheap food or the freshly cut trail. The way we function now, we can have those things because we are free riders on someone else’s poverty. </p>

          <p>We invite other employers to join Landforce and our partners to respect both the work and the worker by paying wages that allow people to live in dignity while together we enjoy the fruits of their labor.</p>
