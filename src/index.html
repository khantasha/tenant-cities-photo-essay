            <p>A pandemic that impacted income for many families also prompted federal, state and local actions to reduce evictions. But a far-reaching full moratorium gave way to much more limited restrictions, even as many renters continued to struggle. The results included more than 3,200 eviction cases filed by landlords in Allegheny County in the past year, sending some tenants scrambling amid COVID-19 and a longstanding affordable housing crisis.</p>

            <p>Since January, PublicSource and WESA have been spending time with households facing eviction, as part of the <a href="https://www.publicsource.org/series/tenant-cities/">Tenant Cities series</a>. We’ve seen tenants try to tap rent relief, scrape to make payments, or take the difficult step of trying to move during a pandemic. Here are portraits of five households we’ve met.</p>

            <p>Shanese Nelson said she’d been renting from her cousin, Todd Davis, since January 2020 and had complained to him about the unfinished state of the Penn Hills apartment – raw wood, unpainted drywall, leaky plumbing,  and more loose light fixtures, closed doors that did not open or close readily and holes in walls.</p>

            <p>When her lease expired in January 10 – even though her rent was current and the pandemic was raging – Davis filed a landlord/tenant complaint against her. Davis did not comment for the record when contacted by PublicSource.</p>

            “I’m hoping that I can get, like, sworn in [by the Air Force] and everything before my eviction date,” she says. “Because they’ll send The Alden a letter saying that because of military reasons, I have to leave.”</p>

            <p>Another mother, Ebony Long, spent the early months of the pandemic doing customer service work for a medical benefits company from home, while caring for a toddler son and, sometimes, her two preteen daughters. But eventually, it got to be too much.</p>

            <p>“I lost my job,” said Long. “And then with me trying to do everything else, pay for food, I'm not getting food stamps. ... I couldn't pay rent.” Her unemployment claim took forever.</p>

            <p>In November, her landlord, Ragab Refaei, filed to evict. Twelve days later, a district judge ruled in Refaei’s favor, giving him the right to have her ousted from the Perry South house.</p>

            <p>Long got help from the Pittsburgh Union of Regional Renters and appealed the decision. During the appeal process, she got caught up on the rent, according to the court filings. Refaei seeks to continue the eviction effort, alleging “illegal activity and disturbing the peace, damage to premises, trash on premises leading to racoon problem [and] unauthorized occupants.”</p>

            <p>She confirmed some damage, but added that she already arranged to pay for repairs. The rest of the allegations, she denied. A judge referred the case to arbitration.</p>

            <p>She’s stayed in a shelter before, and doesn’t think it would be good for her toddler son. “My plan is I've been looking for somewhere else to move, but for now is to just pay this rent.”</p>

And it's not just about people who cannot pay their rent,” he said. “It sounds like to me there's an economic virus and there sounds like to me that there is a hidden agenda” involving “gentrification” and “oppression.”</p>

            <p>He transitioned his 13-year-old son to the son’s mother’s care and got involved with the United Neighborhood Defense Movement, which opposes evictions. But on March 9, a district judge found in favor of Arbors, potentially setting up his ejection.</p>
